        American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
        credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891
        until his death in 1911 that he invented it.
        The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman,
        a postmaster in Canastota, New York. Learn more about it
